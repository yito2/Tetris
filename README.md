# Tetris

This assignment asked to utilize all prior knowledge to replicate a Tetris game. The only guidelines were to use a timer, a Keylistener, and an array to store data. 

The hardest part of this assignment was making an easy-to-operate system while still maintaining the general game aesthetic of the original game. 

Some guidance that I used for my research follows:

The src folder includes the files that will run my code. The game should start upon opening and there are key directions along the bottom. This README includes the directions and references of my project.
